# Senior Mobile Engineer - React Native

## Bio

I'm a results-driven senior software engineer with 10 years of experience specializing in React Native Mobile Application Development. As a react native expert, I have comprehensive experience in the research and development areas and I can make anything from a small mobile app to full large-scale mobile applications.

I'm an enthusiastic & talented team player and am also a deep creative thinker for strategic problem-solving. Working on the previous projects, I learned how to organize the architecture of large-scale data-rich mobile apps with good user experiences.

I am standing at the edge of technologies and working with the most famous technologies like React, Swift, Kotlin etc. Being a kind of faster learner, I'm always hungry to learn new concepts and edge technologies and always strive to implement the best practices in the features.
